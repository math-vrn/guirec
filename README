LPREC


OVERVIEW

A simple easy-to-use GUI for reconstruction tomography data by using the log-polar-based method, for details see:
[1] Andersson, Fredrik, Marcus Carlsson, and Viktor V. Nikitin. "Fast algorithms and efficient GPU implementations 
for the Radon transform and the back-projection operator represented as convolution operators." 
SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 9.2 (2016): 637-664.



DATA FORMATS

Input data must have a standard HDF5 format with dataset names exchange/data, exchange/data_white, exchange/data_dark. 
The output data, a set of reconstructed slices, will be stored as TIFF16 files.



PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION

Parameters for the transform that are automatically loaded from the opened HDF5 file:
h5file - HDF5 file to be processed
recdir - directory for reconstructions
N - number of samples in radial direction (corresponds to the slice reconstruction size N x N)
Nproj - number of samples in angular direction (number of projections projections) covering the interval [0,pi]
Nslice - number of slices in reconstruction
pad - pad sinogra or not

Parameters that are controlled by user:

filter - filter for data inversion (None,ramp,shepp-logan,hann,hamming)
islice - slice number to reconstruct (if empty then reconstruct all slices) 
center - center of object rotation when measuring data
amp - amplitude to normalize the reconstructions [0,amp]



INSTALLATION

To install the package 
1) set variable $CUDAHOME for cuda home directory if nvcc and its libraries are not installed in the default directory (/usr/lib64), 
e.g. export CUDAHOME=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/

2)run python setup.py build


EXECUTION

python build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/lprec.py
